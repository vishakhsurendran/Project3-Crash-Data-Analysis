# Documentation and Resources for Using this Repository
## Operating this Code

In order to operate this code, currently the most secure method would be to run it using CLion. To do this, the Qt Library must be installed and then connected to CLion. Once the Qt Library is installed and properly set up, simply clone this repository into CLion, along with all of its files. Necessary changes have already been made to the CMake file and Qt files, and should function automatically once moved into CLion. After that is done, simply run `main.cpp` and the program will start up. 

Alternatively, the executable which has been created by CLion and stored into the repository can be run from the terminal once the repository has been cloned. However, this method is not guaranteed as it requires a much more intensive set-up process. Therefore, running this code in CLion is currently the safest and most likely way for the program to function properly.
